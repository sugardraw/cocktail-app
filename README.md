# cocktail-app
A REST App with React on the frontend


### Search for Cocktails by giving the ingredients names or create your own cocktail

Lets say, you have some drinks at home and you are wondering, if it will be possible to create a cocktail with this ingredients. Then, you can easily write those names in the input and search for possible cocktails. Or let say, you are a Barkeeper and you want to share your last creation. In these case, you can fill the cocktail maker form and send your new cocktail to the database. AH!, but only if you are registered.
Cheers!
